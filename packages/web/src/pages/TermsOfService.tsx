            <p>
              You retain ownership of all content you create, upload, or publish through Dakyworld
              Hub ("User Content"). By using the platform, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive,
              royalty-free license to store, display, and transmit your User Content solely as
              necessary to provide the service.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-4">5.2 Responsibility for Content</h3>
            <p>
              You are solely responsible for your User Content and for ensuring you have all
              necessary rights and permissions to publish it. We do not pre-screen content but
              reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms or applicable law.

            <p>
              Dakyworld Hub offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans are billed on a
              monthly or annual basis as selected at the time of purchase. All fees are in US dollars
              unless stated otherwise. Payments are processed securely by Stripe.
            </p>

              You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Cancellation
              takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you will retain access until
              then. We do not provide prorated refunds for partial billing periods, except where
              required by law.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-4">7.3 Price Changes</h3>
            <p>
              We may change subscription prices with at least 30 days' notice. Continued use after
              the price change takes effect constitutes acceptance of the new price.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-4">7.4 Failed Payments</h3>
            <p>
              If a payment fails, we may suspend your account after a grace period and retry the
              payment. Accounts with outstanding balances may be terminated after 30 days.
