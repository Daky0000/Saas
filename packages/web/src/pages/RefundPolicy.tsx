            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
            <p>
              All new paid subscriptions are eligible for a full refund within <strong>14 calendar
              days</strong> of the initial payment date. If you are not satisfied with our service for
              any reason, contact us within this window and we will process a full refund — no
              questions asked.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              The 14-day guarantee applies to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>First-time subscriptions to any paid plan (Starter, Pro, or Business)</li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Subscription Renewals</h2>
            <p>
              Dakyworld subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or
              annually). We send a reminder email <strong>7 days before</strong> each renewal so you
              have time to cancel if you no longer wish to continue.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Renewal charges are generally non-refundable. However, if you contact us within{' '}
              <strong>48 hours</strong> of an unintended renewal — for example, you forgot to cancel
              and have not used the service during the new period — we will review your case and may
              issue a discretionary refund.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Annual Plans</h2>
            <p>
              Annual subscribers who cancel mid-cycle are eligible for a <strong>pro-rated
              refund</strong> of the unused full months remaining, minus any discount received for
              choosing the annual plan over monthly billing.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">Example: if you subscribed to an annual plan, used 4 months, and then
              cancelled, you may be refunded for the remaining 8 months at the standard monthly rate,
              less the annual discount benefit applied to the first 4 months.

            <p>
              We ask that you contact us directly before initiating a chargeback with your bank or
              card issuer. Most billing disputes can be resolved quickly and amicably. Initiating an
              unjustified chargeback may result in suspension of your account and affect your ability
              to re-subscribe in the future.

            <p>
              Cancelling your subscription stops future billing but does <strong>not</strong>{' '}
              automatically trigger a refund for the current billing period. You will retain access to
              paid features until the end of the period you have already paid for. If you also want a
              refund for the current period, you must explicitly request one following the process in
              Section 6.

            <p>
              All payments and refunds are processed in US dollars (USD) via Stripe. If your bank
              account is in a different currency, your bank's exchange rate at the time of the refund
              may differ from the rate at the time of the original charge. Dakyworld is not responsible
              for any currency conversion differences.
